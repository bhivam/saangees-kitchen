    /**
     * Creates and enqueues a new message to be sent.
     *
     * Messages are always sent asynchronously. When you hit this endpoint, the message
     * will be created within Surge's system and enqueued for sending, and then the id
     * for the new message will be returned. When the message is actually sent, a
     * `message.sent` webhook event will be triggered and sent to any webhook endpoints
     * that you have subscribed to this event type. Then a `message.delivered` webhook
     * event will be triggered when the carrier sends us a delivery receipt.
     *
     * By default all messages will be sent immediately. If you would like to schedule
     * sending for some time up to 60 days in the future, you can do that by providing
     * a value for the `send_at` field. This should be formatted as an ISO8601 datetime
     * like `2028-10-14T18:06:00Z`.
     *
     * You must include either a `body` or `attachments` field (or both) in the request
     * body. The `body` field should contain the text of the message you want to send,
     * and the `attachments` field should be an array of objects with a `url` field
     * pointing to the file you want to attach. Surge will download these files and
     * send them as attachments in the message.
     *
     * You can provide either a `conversation` object or a `to` field to specify the
     * intended recipient of the message, but an error will be returned if both fields
     * are provided. Similarly the `from` field cannot be used together with the
     * `conversation` field, and `conversation.phone_number` should be specified
     * instead.
     *
     * @example
     * ```ts
     * const message = await client.messages.create(
     *   'acct_01j9a43avnfqzbjfch6pygv1td',
     *   {
     *     conversation: {
     *       contact: { phone_number: '+18015551234' },
     *     },
     *   },
     * );
     * ```

     *

     * const message = await client.messages.retrieve(
